### Numbers & Floats

**PEMDAS** >> "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"

example

```
>>> 10-3*5+8
3
>>> (10-3)*(5+8)
91
>>>
int(11.9) => this will provide a result of 11.
```

If you notice it doesn't round, it just takes the number before the .

Other examples of converting numbers to floats and strings to numbers

```
>>> int("11") // example of converting a string to a number
11
>>> float("11") // example of converting a string to a float
11.0
>>> float(11) // example of converting a number to a decimal
11.0
>>> int(11.9) // example of converting a float into a number
11
>>>
```

### Strings

Is a list of characters, string literals can be either single or double quotes.

Strings are also immutable (can't be changed)

The two options come in handy when you have examples like

"I can't understand" It allows the ' to be treated as a character.

A symbol for **concatenation** `+=`
